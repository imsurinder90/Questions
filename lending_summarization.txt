Hi

Approach and understanding:
1. Analysed the dataset given and understands each of the feature using the dictionary file explaining each feature.
2. Removed the feature columns in which more than 80% of the rows are empty.
3. Feature Selection: Find out the feature which contribues/ have relship. with Target variable by looking manually at the columns and finding correlation and plotting heatmap. It helped in finding positive and negative correlation between the features.
4. Kept only two classes of Target variable "Fully Paid" and "Charged Off", removed other category since we have enough data to analyse.
5. Imputed the feature values some with zeros and some with mean.
6. One Hot encoded the categorical features to enhace the model predictive power.
7. Scaled the numeric data.
8. ROC curve is used to check the model performance on Unbalanced and balanced dataset.
9. Plotted cross-validation scores, ROC curves and confusion matrix.
10. Find out the optimal threshold value for ROC curve where model performs good.
11. Grid Search is used with Random Forest Classifier to find the best params where RF works well.
12. Various plots and visualizations are used to better understand the data.

Model used:
1. LinearDiscriminantAnalysis
2. MultinomialNB
3. RandomForestClassifier
4. LogisticRegression
Used cross-validation to check if model built is generalized on all dataset or not.
In Loan approval applications, we can't rely on the default threhold 0.5 for LogisticRegression so we can change it the way we can find more defaults and more loan applications approval.
So, ROC curve cutt off is determined.

I could refine the features more but couldn't due to time constraint.

Thanks,
Surinder
